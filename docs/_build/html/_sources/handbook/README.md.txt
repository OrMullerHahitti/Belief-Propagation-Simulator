# PropFlow Deployment Handbook

This handbook centralises all information required to understand, deploy, and operate the PropFlow belief propagation simulator. It is structured as a sequence of focused guides:

1. [Conceptual Overview](01_conceptual_overview.md)
2. [System Setup & Dependencies](02_system_setup.md)
3. [Running Simulations & Tools](03_running_simulations.md)
4. [Deployment Playbooks](04_deployment_playbooks.md)
5. [Development Workflow](05_development_workflow.md)
6. [Reference Tables](06_reference.md)
7. [Troubleshooting & FAQ](07_troubleshooting.md)

Each section can be read independently, but new users are encouraged to start with the conceptual overview, follow the setup instructions, and then progress to deployment and operations.
