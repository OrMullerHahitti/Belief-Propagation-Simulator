# Belief-Propagation-Simulator

## Overview
The **Belief-Propagation-Simulator** is a Python toolkit for building and experimenting with belief propagation algorithms on factor graphs. It was designed for research and education purposes and provides a flexible framework for implementing and testing new policies and engine variants.

## Key Features
- **Belief Propagation Subproblems**: Simulates a variety of belief propagation variants.
- **Factor Graph Support**: Operates on arbitrary factor graphs with built-in tools for graph construction and configuration.
- **Extensible Framework**: Modular policy system designed to support additional inference algorithms.
- **Graph State Persistence**: Save and load graph states efficiently using pickle files.
- **Debugging and Logging**: Integrated logging for debugging and monitoring.

## Installation
Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install belief-propagation-simulator
```

To work with the latest development version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrMullerHahitti/Belief-Propagation-Simulator.git
cd Belief-Propagation-Simulator
pip install -e .
```
